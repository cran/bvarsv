\emph{Note: The underlying FRED series are coded ``GDPC96'', ``GDPDEF'' and ``TB3MS''. The gdp and inflation series are defined as 400 times the difference of the log of the original series (i.e., annualized log growth rates). The treasury bill interest rate is the quarterly average of the monthly FRED series.}
